### International teams working across time-zones

Note that the teams are part of larger international teams working across time-zones (esp. in US West-coast time-zone - PT, which is 9 hours behind CET time-zone in Europe, so 9am PT is 18 CET).
Expect, that the job will require also occasional availability in US West-coast business hours.

It does not mean you have to work more or longer hours!
Your work hours will be flexible, but the job will require you at times to attend some meetings, or communicate with some colleagues at hours outside of "classic" European business hours.
While it is manageable, it is something to consider as it may impact your established schedule and it may require some flexibility from your side.

If you have questions, or concerns, please bring it up in your discussion with primary contact above.

Note that our larger teams already have a few individual remote workers working from Europe, incl. Prague.
Our US-based team members are used to working with remote workers in Europe and to accomodate to their availability limitations.
We can share some of their experiences with you if it helps you to make a decision.


## FAQ


### What if I am interested?

We recommend to reach out to the primary contact listed above to:
* **Discuss your experience and fit for the role.**
* Learn more about the position, team dynamics, the location, team culture, etc.


### Can I apply directly to the job posting?

Yes, you can.
However, starting the discussion with primary contact will help you learn more upfront and it will give us information about your fit for the role.
It is also more interactive (while asynchronous) communication channel.
Typically it gives candidates higher chance to highlight relevant things than just submitting their resume.


### Should I send you my resume?

For **Base Class Libraries / Networking team** ([@ziki_cz](https://twitter.com/ziki_cz)), please start with answering the 2 questions above before you send over your resume.

For **.NET Engineering Services team** ([@ElaMoscicka](https://twitter.com/ElaMoscicka)), please start chat with her via email [elmoscic@microsoft.com](mailto:elmoscic@microsoft.com) (please do NOT send your resume/CV via email due to GDPR).


### What should I highlight in my resume?

Make sure you include things which are relevant.

**Pro-tip:** Great way to highlight your relevant experiences in resume/CV, is to start with first page as "cover letter".
Describe most relevant things and why do you think you are a good fit for the job position.
