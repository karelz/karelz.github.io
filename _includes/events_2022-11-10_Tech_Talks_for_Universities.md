## Talks

You will have a chance to meet some of the top industry speakers during their visit in Prague.

- 18:00-18:30 - **Reflections on projects at boiling point** by [Bronwen Zande](https://twitter.com/BronwenZ)
  - Abstract:
    - Software projects involve so many choices: what process, tools, languages,  architecture do you choose that will make your project a success?
    <br/>
    Spoiler alert: Rarely are any of these choices the reason projects fail or succeed.	
    <br/>
    Bronwen has been a software developer, on the tools for more years than not.
    <br/>
    Join her as she discusses a selection of patterns that can make or break any project, how they come about, and how to get out in front.

- 18:30-19:00 - **Why crazy ideas pay off** by [Konrad Kokosa](https://twitter.com/konradkokosa)
  - Abstract:
    - This is a presentation that I would like to tell myself right after graduation, many years ago. During my first years of professional job, the excitement went away and burnout started to occur. But luckily, eventually I've understood how I can have fun from what I'm doing!
    <br/>
    How having personal brand can help? Do you have to publish TikTok videos while jumping out of the window and screaming 'Java makes you fly' to build any recognition? It may be fun but I will show you better path!

- 19:00-19:30 - **Open Source - How it can help your career** by [Poornima Nayar](https://twitter.com/PoornimaNayar)
  - Abstract:
    - (to be published by 10/31)
  - About speaker: see [Poornima Nayar's bio at Update Conference](https://www.updateconference.net/en/2022/speaker/poornima-nayar)

- 19:30-20:00 - **When fate conspires against you** by [Kevin Gosse](https://twitter.com/KooKiz)
  - Abstract:
    - When working at scale, it becomes more important to plan for failure than trying to avoid it. From neutrinos to typhoons, I'll illustrate this concept through stories taken from my professional experience, about how the most improbable conditions are bound to be reunited and will inevitably make your systems fail.
