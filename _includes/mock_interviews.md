# Mock Interviews for Microsoft Developer Position

I have decided to offer a dry run / mock interviews for developer position "a la Microsoft" to community.
My [announcement](https://twitter.com/ziki_cz/status/1081153149187117058) received some 40+ interests, so here is fullfillment of my part ...

Update on 2019/6/1:
After 3 mock interviews in first 4 months, I realized I don't have as much time as I hoped for.
Therefore I decided to change the preparation requirements to make the mock interviews really worthwhile for both sides - you, the candidate and me.
The goal is to save each others' time and for me to scale better.

## Personal offer, nothing Microsoft official

First and foremost, this is a personal offer.
I will do the mock interviews in my spare time, not on company time (although my work hours are flexible).
It is not part of my job.
My employer, Microsoft, does not sponsor or encourage the effort in any way known to me.

## Why me?

I am fairly experienced interviewer in Microsoft.
I like doing interviews and I conducted probably around 200 of them in last few years.
Half of them were "quick" 30 minute screenings on college campuses in US & Canada, but still interviews.

## What's in it for me?

Nothing, at least materially.
This is my way of giving back something to the community.
I do not expect any payments, compensations or endorsements for it as a reward or payback.

Although, I will ask you afterwords to give me a recommendation (in your own words) about your experience on LinkedIn, if you can.
If you can't, that is fine too.
Main reason for the recommendation is to help me build trust relationship with other candidates in future faster and provide insight what to expect and about usefulness of the mock interview from different point of view.

Overall I will also ask you: If you have feedback on the interview from your side, please share it with me - it will help me get better as interviewer and it will also allow me to steer the mock interview effort in a direction useful to the participants.

## Who is it for?

Primary target audience are developers who plan to **interview with Microsoft** in near future, but are not sure with themselves and would love to "try it out" first to understand the experience and be better prepared.
It is something I would have welcomed myself before interviewing with Microsoft in 2005.

The reasons people participate may vary - from just lowering their stress, confirming their technical knowledge, or testing their language skills (interview in English can be intimidating to many non-native speakers like me).
I won't judge your reasons, I may ask out of curiosity :).

## What to expect?

First, while you can expect a reasonably seasoned interviewer to talk to you over email and eventually over Skype, please beware that I don't claim to be the best interviewer ever, or someone who knows exactly how things are.
All I am offering is my personal experience and my personal view point.

You may disagree with me and that is perfectly fine.
If I tell you my honest opinion after the mock interview, or if I recommend improvements to your resume, it does not mean I am right and I know the best.
You should view it as one view point and it is totally up to you if you want to act on my recommendations or ignore them.

Here's what I expect will happen:

1. Prepare for the interview - see section below.
1. Send to my [private email address](mailto:ZikiCZ@hotmail.com):
    * Your resume (in a structure you plan to send it to Microsoft).
        * I won't share your resume with anyone unless I get explicit permission from you.
    * Short text about what kind of developer job, or product you would like to work on (e.g. Windows, Office, Bing, Dynamics, Azure, XBox, games, UI applications, Visual Studio, compilers, frameworks, etc.).
        * If you don't know, that is fine. (I didn't have specific idea either before joining Microsoft ;))
        * Motivation: It will help me give you better feedback on your resume.
    * When you plan to interview for Microsoft.
1. I will prioritize incoming requests with these criteria:
    * Underrepresented groups in SW engineering (let me know if you're in one).
    * People with nearest interview deadlines / plans.
    * Everybody else.
1. I will provide resume feedback via email if needed (first impressions, how it matches your desired job profile, etc.)
1. I will schedule [Skype interview](https://www.skype.com/en/interviews) with you  - 1h.
    * Originally I hoped to do 1-2 mock interviews each week, but that was just wishful thinking. In reality it is barely 1 per month :( ... although I could try to use lame excuse that I needed to experiment first and fine-tune the process, but that would be mostly a lie. Anyway,  I will try to keep doing them here and there when the workload at daily job permits it (which may be a while). I will focus more on resume reviews when possible.
1. We will do the mock interview.
    * Expect me to start the mock interview the same way as in a real interview - including introduction, warm up questions, etc. The full experience.
        * Note: I always allow programming language of choice, pseudo-language or even mix of languages - the ideas are important, not the syntax.
    * Debrief at the end with direct and honest feedback (10 min).
        * Would I give you 'hire' or not? And why?
        * Details on what went well, what didn't go well and how it matched expectations.
        * What to improve / look for.
1. After the mock interview:
    * I will welcome direct honest feedback the other way - How did you feel during the interview? Could I do something better as interviewer? Or as part of this mock interview effort?
    * I will ask you to NOT disclose my interview question. I plan to use it for other mock interviews and wider knowledge would undermine the effort here.

## How to prepare?

I expect that you are already fully prepared for Microsoft interview.
Research resources online and/or read books about interviews in larger companies like Microsoft.
Go trough some examples.
Practice on paper.
Verify solution on computer.
Talk with your friends about it, discuss options - their pros and cons.
Practice, using online tools like http://leetcode.com.

Check out tips from Microsoft recruiters: [How to ace a technical interview at Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/life/how-to-ace-a-technical-interview-at-microsoft).

I personally expect from candidates:

* Knowledge of basic data structures and their algorithms like working with strings, lists, binary trees, basic graph algorithms (search), basic sorting.
* Ability to understand and analyze problems, identify the right basic data structures and algorithms in them.
* Basic O-notation cost analysis of algorithms and solutions.
* Adaptability. Passion for technology, coding and solving problems. Ability to retrospect and learn from your past projects - successes and failures. Honesty with yourself and others. Desire to get better and grow (at your own pace). Being a team player.

### Recommendation: Online coding practice

I have discovered and tried http://leetcode.com recently.
It seems to be great prep tool for interviews.
Choose Category - **Algorithms**, difficulty **Hard**.
Do a few, get into position when you can nail them without looking at solution first.
Note that some problems may be better than others for preparation for interview.

I personally tried 2 problems and found them very useful for interview preparation.
I could imagine asking problems like those in real interview.

I also failed the first problem misserably (I needed 5 submissions to get all corner cases right - oh my!).
Definitely not up to my standards, it was pretty emberrassing for me.
Apprarently I was overconfident and thought I can do it easily, so I got sloppy and did not pay attention to details.
It thaught me a lesson right on the spot - it demonstrates that some preparation is useful even for skilled interviewers.
Luckily, I nailed the second problem, which gave me my confidence back (at reasonable level) :).

Here's list of problems I tried:
  * #224 [Basic Calculator](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/)
  * #45 [Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

If I get time (that may be unrealistic expectation), I may try more problems and put the interesting ones here.

### Recommendation: Book about interviewing for Microsoft

I can recommend book [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) - I read the [5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) in February 2019 (to be able to provide to useful resources here ;)), and it is very spot on.

In particular, I liked these parts of the book:
* I. Interview Process - Dress Code, Top 10 Mistakes
* II. Behind the Scenes - The Microsoft Interview
* IV. Before the Interview - Getting the Right Experience, Writing a Great Resume
    * BTW: Contributing to GitHub projects, or having your own smaller project on GitHub is a great way how to show your coding capabilities upfront. However, it is not a must-have - some people may not be priviledged to have that time.
* V. Behavioral Questions
* VI. Technical Questions
    * Data Structures - Really great basic questions everyone should be able to do.
    * Concepts and Algorithms - While I don't think most of these are good interview questions (some Bit Manipulation questions are rather ugly), it is worth going through them all to ensure yourself you understand basic concepts and some "known" tricks (e.g. in Brain Teasers).
    * Additional Review Problems - I didn't review them carefully, but they seem to be good things to practice on as well. I'd recommend to check them out.

### Recommendation: Other online resources for questions

From a quick 10-minute online research I found for example this [list of interview questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practice-for-cracking-any-coding-interview) which I liked.

I actually even found my most used interview question in the list.
It is a question I use in almost all 30-min college campus interviews, which means I used it about 80 times.
Interestingly, I haven't met a single person who knew the question upfront (I would recognize if they did and lied or didn't tell me) - I guess people do not prepare that due diligently or didn't find this site yet :).

### Story: My interview at Microsoft

Before interviewing for Microsoft in 2005 with a friend, we used a web page of 100-ish inteview questions to practice.
Those questions were very similar to those listed above in my recommendations.
Back then they included even the "weird" questions which are not used anymore like "How many gas stations are in US" or "Why are manholes round".

I remember coming to the interview confident I can ace most of the questions on the list.
I felt like I can nail almost any technical problem with lists, trees, graphs and beyond, especially the complicated ones.
I prepared for all the known tricks and games on the list, like Hanoi towers, identifying oddly-weighted ball, etc.

I was shocked and felt almost cheated when the most difficult coding question I got was simple binary search (granted, hidden in a real-world problem of debugger scenario: finding the right method name from IP address in a sorted symbol index at the end of DLL).
I almost couldn't believe my eyes: I was super alert, looking for some trick hiding around the corner.
There was none.

For a long time I didn't understand why it was sufficient for the interviewers to ask me such question.
Now I do.
Now I understand that you can find a lot of things about how the candidate thinks, how they keep attention to details, how they react to follow up questions, etc.
Now I understand that the "warm up" questions about past experience  (what went well/wrong, what was difficult) can tell the interviewer a LOT.
Often even more than the technical coding question itself.

From my loop of 4 interviews I remember one more question which stood out and blew my mind.
It was the last question, clearly targeted at general problem solving.
It started innocently with probing what are my hobbies.
I didn't have any significant hobbies back then (I still don't have), so I said first thing that came to my mind: snowboarding (I just started learning snowboarding and went twice).

I immediately got a great question: "How would you design a snowboard"?
That was not something I expected, it threw me off a bit, but very quickly I found it as a cool challenge - sky is the limit :).
And I generated ideas, I asked for limits (standalone funded team/company, you are in charge).
It was very cool.
I enjoyed it on the spot and I think it showed (in a positive way).
I covered a lot of things, incl. testing, what is important, who are customers, who can help (hire experts), etc.
It was very similar to SW design, working in a team, choosing the right features, etc.

Funny enough, in the last minute of the interview when we were almost wrapping up (the question "Anything else?"), I realized I entirely forgot about security.
The entire 45 minutes I did not mention any worry about the product being safe for users.
I felt emberassed and disappointed with myself that I forgot about such basic and almost most important thing.
And I said so out loud.

Looking at it back, even such genuine reactions ("oh my gosh, how could I forget about something important as this") and systematic approach to things (list all aspects you covered or should cover) are very important during interview.
They tell the interviewer about maturity of the candidate.
They show your human face.
They demonstrate how you behave in ambiguous situations, how you deal with setbacks, how you attack problems when things are stacked against you.
Overall a great interview question IMO.
